Description: Fitting the space-time Epidemic Type
        Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model to earthquake catalogs
        using a stochastic declustering approach.
        The ETAS model is a spatio-temporal marked point process
        model and a special case of the Hawcks process.
        The package is based on Fortran code by Jiancang Zhuang
        (available at http://bemlar.ism.ac.jp/zhuang/software.html),
        which is translated into C such that it can be called from R.
